# Pitch-Perfect-Vocal-Training

Pitch Perfect is a game that makes vocal training more engaging and offers instant visual feedback for singers so they can get more out of their vocal training exercises. The goal is to make vocal training more fun and motivating by giving user's reliable feedback, stats, scores and personalisation.

Using vocal controls and pitch detection you are able to visualise your voice and gain instant feedback. There is a wide array of exercises taylored to your specific needs so you can choose the exercise that best suits you.

Every pitch held perfectly gives you points so you can keep track of how well you're doing. Earn a perfect score and master your own voice!

All you need is a microphone and a computer and you can sing your heart out.

I've made use of the Pitch Detection code from Unity's [NativeAudioPlugins](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NativeAudioPlugins)

The functionality I've added is described in the Pitch Detection script file but I'll summarise:
+ Added point detection for hitting correct notes by making use of Signal Triggers on the TimeLine
+ Added detailed Stat Screen to give users feedback and insight into their vocal training 

This Project is meant to be loaded with the Unity Native Audio Plugins project
Simply drag all Assets into Native Audio Plugins for the added functionality to work
